I am a PhD student in the **Math** at **UBC**, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Colin Macdonald](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cbm/) and [Prof. Bhushan Gopaluni](https://dais.chbe.ubc.ca/about/)
.

My research focuses on **Numerical Method** and **Scientific Computing**, with a specific interest in **[Sub-field 1]** and **[Sub-field 2]**. Previously, I completed my Master's at UBC.

Currently, I am working on [current project]. My goal is to build systems that [work].

In my free time, I enjoy [Hobby 1] and [Hobby 2].
